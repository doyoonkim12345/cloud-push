# Custom

## Create Custom `StorageClient`

```ts
import { StorageClient } from "@cloud-push/cloud";

const storageClient: StorageClient = {
    getFile: () => {},
    getFileSignedUrl: () => {},
    uploadDirectory: () => {},
    uploadFile: () => {},
    uploadLocalFile: () => {},
};
```

---

### `getFile`

```ts
getFile({ key }: { key: string }): Promise<Uint8Array>
```

>Fetches the file associated with the specified `key` from cloud storage and returns it as a `Uint8Array`.

---

### `getFileSignedUrl`

```ts
getFileSignedUrl({ key, expiresIn }: { key: string; expiresIn?: number }): Promise<string>
```

>Generates and returns a **signed URL** to access the specified file.
`expiresIn` (optional) sets the expiration time of the URL in seconds.

---

### `uploadFile`

```ts
uploadFile({
  key,
  file,
  contentType,
}: {
  key: string;
  file: Uint8Array;
  contentType?: string;
}): Promise<void>
```

>Uploads a file in `Uint8Array` format to cloud storage.
You can optionally specify the MIME type via `contentType` (default: `"application/json"`).

---

### `uploadLocalFile`

```ts
uploadLocalFile({
  fileName,
  filePath,
}: {
  fileName: string;
  filePath: string;
}): Promise<string | undefined>
```

>Uploads a file from a local path **using a stream**, and returns the uploaded object's URL.

---

### `uploadDirectory`

```ts
uploadDirectory({
  cloudPath,
  directoryPath,
}: {
  cloudPath: string;
  directoryPath: string;
}): Promise<void>
```

>Uploads all files in a local directory to cloud storage.

---

## Examples

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@cloud-push/react-native";
import { StorageClient } from "@cloud-push/cloud";

const storageClient: StorageClient = {
    getFile: () => {},
    getFileSignedUrl: () => {},
    uploadDirectory: () => {},
    uploadFile: () => {},
    uploadLocalFile: () => {},
};

const dbClient: DbClient = {
  create: () => {},
  delete: () => {},
  find: () => {},
  findAll: () => {},
  readAll: () => {},
  toUint8Array: () => {},
  update: () => {},
};

export default defineConfig(() => ({
  storage: storageClient,
  db: dbClient,
}));
```
