# Environment variables

Environment variables are used when using [dbClient](/guide/4.cloud/2.dbClients.html) and [storageClient](/guide/4.cloud/1.storageClients.html) or when creating bundles, and support both `.env` and `eas env`.
You can decide where to load environment variables from each time you need to use them.

## Supported environments

```ts
type Environment = "production" | "development" | "preview";
```

As with expo, environments are limited to **production**, **development**, and **preview**.

## 1. `eas env`

If you use `eas env`, environment variables are loaded from [expo.dev](https://expo.dev). To use this option, your project **must be set up so it can be found on [expo.dev](https://expo.dev)]**, and the environment variables you want to use must be properly set for each environment. Also, **the cloud-push execution environment must be set up so that eas can be used**.

## 2. `.env`

The lower you go, the **higher the priority** (overrides previous values).

| Order | Filename                   | Description                              | Example                  |
| ----- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 1     | `.env`                     | Default                                  | `.env`                   |
| 2     | `.env.{environment}`       | Per-environment value                    | `.env.development`       |
| 3     | `.env.local`               | Local common override                    | `.env.local`             |
| 4     | `.env.{environment}.local` | Per-environment local override (highest) | `.env.development.local` |
