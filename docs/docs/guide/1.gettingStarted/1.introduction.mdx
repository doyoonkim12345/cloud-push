## 🚀 Motivation

Expo projects are highly customized React Native projects. Because of this, available CodePush solutions are limited.  
This project, inspired by [`hot-updater`](https://github.com/gronxb/hot-updater), offers an alternative way to manage bundles using storage services like S3, Firebase, Supabase, etc.  
It follows [Expo Updates technical specs](https://docs.expo.dev/technical-specs/expo-updates-1/) and maintains compatibility with Expo Updates.
