# Custom

## Create Custom `DbClient`

```ts
import { StorageClient } from "@cloud-push/cloud";

const dbClient: DbClient = {
  create: () => {},
  delete: () => {},
  find: () => {},
  findAll: () => {},
  readAll: () => {},
  toUint8Array: () => {},
  update: () => {},
};
```

## `create`

```ts
create({ bundle }: { bundle: Bundle }): Promise<void>
```

> Inserts the given `bundle` object into the Supabase table. Throws an error if the operation fails.

---

## `readAll`

```ts
readAll(): Promise<Bundle[]>
```

> Retrieves all records from the table and returns them as an array of `Bundle`. Throws an error on failure.

---

## `find`

```ts
find({ conditions }: { conditions: FindCondition<Bundle> }): Promise<Bundle | null>
```

> Finds the first `Bundle` that matches the given conditions. Returns `null` if no match is found. Other errors are thrown as is.

---

## `findAll`

```ts
findAll({
  conditions,
  sortOptions,
}: {
  conditions: FindCondition<Bundle>;
  sortOptions?: SortOption<Bundle>[];
}): Promise<Bundle[]>
```

> Finds multiple `Bundle` records matching the given conditions, optionally applying sorting based on the provided fields and directions.

---

## `update`

```ts
update({ bundle }: { bundle: Bundle }): Promise<void>
```

> Updates the existing record whose `bundleId` matches the given `bundle`.

---

## `delete`

```ts
delete({ bundleId }: { bundleId: string }): Promise<void>
```

> Deletes the record from Supabase that matches the given `bundleId`.

---

## `toUint8Array`

```ts
toUint8Array(): Promise<Uint8Array>
```

> Retrieves all `bundle` records, serializes them to JSON, and encodes them as a `Uint8Array`.

---

## Examples

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@cloud-push/cli";
import { StorageClient } from "@cloud-push/cloud";


export default defineConfig(() => ({
  	loadClients: () => {
        
      const storageClient: StorageClient = {
          getFile: () => {},
          getFileSignedUrl: () => {},
          uploadDirectory: () => {},
          uploadFile: () => {},
          uploadLocalFile: () => {},
      };

      const dbClient: DbClient = {
        create: () => {},
        delete: () => {},
        find: () => {},
        findAll: () => {},
        readAll: () => {},
        toUint8Array: () => {},
        update: () => {},
      };

      return {
        storage: storageClient,
        db: dbClient,
      };
	},
}));
```
